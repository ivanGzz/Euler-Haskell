## Project Euler Haskell

About [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

### Usage

If you have a standard GHCI installation you should be able to run each solution with

    Prelude> :l ProblemN
    Prelude> problemN 

in the Terminal or the CMD.

Each program will only print its numeric solution.

### Disclaimer

I am using the problems from Project Euler to apply my new knowledge about the Haskell programming language. The solutions
are correct but I don't ensure that they are optimal. Please use it only as learning resource.
